# ReactQuizXpress
ReactQuizXpress is a web app built using React, and more specifically it is a quiz consisting of 20 questions about the very same framework. 

## Key Features 

- Quiz: the user can answer to the 20 questions which make up the quiz 
- Navigation Using Control Buttons: go to the previous or next question, or finish the quiz by using the provided controls
- Compare Answers: at the end of the quiz, you can compare your answers to the correct ones to see how you perform
- Score: each correct answer is valued at 5 points, the maximum score being 100

## Technologies Used 

- HTML5 
- CSS3
- React JS 

## Approach 

The whole project is made up of 3 main parts plus the subsequent components which make up the composition of the said 3 parts. I have used the Context API of React to manage the general state of the application, in order to avoid prop drilling, make the code easier to maintain and have more modularity.
